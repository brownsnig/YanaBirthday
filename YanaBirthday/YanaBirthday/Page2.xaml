But when I met you, I realized that I had nothing to fear. You are the best possible sister, friend, and partner-in-crime that I could ask for, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. "

You juggle so many extracurriculars, have perfect grades, and most importantly, are such a kind, fun human being who always places her friends before herselves. You're the role model human that the rest of us should try to be. Please, no matter what anyone says or does, do not change - your personality is unique and shines up an entire room."                      HorizontalOptions="CenterAndExpand"

There is absolutely no one else I'd dance on the streets with, that I'd dance with while driving, that I'd trust so deeply with all my inner thoughts. Whenever something happens to me I always feel this instant urge to tell you, and I'm so glad that I'm able to share all of this with you. We both have weird 'tea' and weird gossip in general but I think it's our weirdness that sets us apart, and I love it."

How could the one experience I'd been looking forward to for ages be taken away from me like this? But, now, I'm so happy that I'm here for at least a few more months, because I get to be close to my best friend! I love our walks trespassing through the nursery and spilling extremely hot burn-your-tongue 'tea' and I'm glad I get another quarter of it. "
